Stratified Sampling from Excel Data
This script reads data from an Excel file, performs stratified sampling based on a specified column, and then writes the sampled data along with its distribution to a new Excel file. Additionally, it plots a comparison of the distributions of the original and sampled data.

Requirements
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage
Ensure your data is in an Excel file format (e.g., test_file.xlsx).
Modify the file_path variable in the script to point to your Excel file.
If you wish to stratify based on a different column, modify the strata_column variable.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python stratified_sampling_script.py
The script will create an output Excel file (sampled_data_SK_Employment.xlsx by default) with two sheets:

Sampled Data: Contains the stratified samples.
Distribution: Compares the distribution of the original dataset to the sampled data.
A bar chart comparing the distributions will also be displayed.

Overview of the Code
Reading the Excel File: The script starts by reading data from an Excel file into a pandas DataFrame.
Stratified Sampling: The data is stratified based on the column 'Q11 (Employment Status)' by default. The stratified sampling ensures each category in the column is proportionally represented in the sample.
Writing to a New Excel File: The sampled data and its distribution are written to a new Excel file.
Plotting the Distribution Comparison: A bar chart is generated to visually compare the distribution of the original dataset to the sampled data.
Customization
To change the input or output file names, modify the file_path and output_path variables, respectively.
To stratify based on a different column, modify the strata_column variable.
